## INJURY INTELLIGENCE & SAFETY PROTOCOLS

**USER NOTES ANALYSIS:** "${notes || 'No specific limitations mentioned'}"

${notes ? `
‚ö†Ô∏è INJURY RISK ASSESSMENT ACTIVE:
- SCAN for keywords: back pain, knee issues, shoulder problems, neck pain, wrist pain, ankle issues, recent injury, surgery, arthritis, pregnancy, beginner, elderly
- If ANY injury keywords detected: AUTOMATICALLY exclude contraindicated exercises
- PRIORITIZE: Joint-friendly alternatives, supported movements, pain-free ranges
- INCLUDE: Specific form cues for injury prevention and modifications
- EMPHASIZE: "Stop if pain occurs" messaging in instructions
` : `
‚úÖ NO SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS NOTED:
- Proceed with standard exercise selection
- Include general injury prevention form cues
- Maintain conservative progression for unknown fitness level
`}

## CONTEXTUAL WORKOUT ARCHITECTURE

**DURATION-BASED STRUCTURE:**
${duration <= 10 ? `
‚è∞ QUICK SESSION (${duration} min):
- Warmup: 2-3 exercises (2-3 minutes)
- Main: 2-4 exercises (${duration - 5}-${duration - 4} minutes)
- Cooldown: 1-2 exercises (1-2 minutes)
- FOCUS: High-impact movements, efficient compound exercises
` : duration <= 30 ? `
‚è∞ STANDARD SESSION (${duration} min):
- Warmup: 3-4 exercises (5-7 minutes)
- Main: 4-6 exercises (${duration - 12}-${duration - 8} minutes)
- Cooldown: 2-3 exercises (3-5 minutes)
- FOCUS: Balanced progression with adequate preparation
` : `
‚è∞ EXTENDED SESSION (${duration} min):
- Warmup: 4-5 exercises (8-10 minutes)
- Main: 6-8 exercises (${duration - 18}-${duration - 15} minutes)
- Cooldown: 3-4 exercises (5-8 minutes)
- FOCUS: Comprehensive training with full progression
`}

## EXERCISE SELECTION INTELLIGENCE

**WARMUP REQUIREMENTS:**
- Start with gentle mobility and activation
- Progress from small to large movements
- Include joint rotations and dynamic stretches
- Prepare specific areas for the main workout focus
- Match the intensity of upcoming exercises

**MAIN WORKOUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Select exercises that honor ALL user constraints
- Create logical progression in difficulty
- Include the specified focus area as 60-70% of exercises
- Balance muscle groups and movement patterns
- Ensure exercises flow well together

**COOLDOWN REQUIREMENTS:**
- Gradually lower heart rate and intensity
- Include static stretches for worked muscles
- Promote recovery and flexibility
- End with calming, restorative movements

## PERSONALIZATION DEPTH

**EXPERIENCE ADAPTATION:**
- If "beginner" mentioned: Emphasize basic movements with extra detailed instructions
- If advanced terms used: Include more complex movement patterns
- Default: Assume intermediate level with clear, comprehensive instructions

**BREATHING & RECOVERY INTEGRATION:**
- Include breathing cues in high-intensity portions
- Specify rest periods based on intensity level
- Add recovery tips between challenging exercises
- Integrate mindfulness cues for cooldown
